I made this website purely for enjoyment, self-learning, and as a platform to showcase my personal portfolios.
**At the moment the website is not complete. I plan to keep on updating it throughout the future.**

For server programming the Python language along with the Django Framwork was used.
For the website-side I used Javascript, CSS3 and Html5

**DID NOT UPLOADE FONT-AWESOME SINCE THE FILE IS TOO BIG**

# Website 

**Home:**
- Website Home page. Simple home page with peronsal introduction.
